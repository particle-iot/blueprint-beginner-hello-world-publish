introduction: |
  This beginner-friendly blueprint demonstrates how to use Particle Cloud functions
  to trigger a "Hello World" publish event. It’s a minimal and reliable way to
  confirm your device is connected and responding to cloud commands.
description: |
  The firmware registers a cloud function called `sayHello`. When the function
  is invoked from the Console or API, the handler publishes an event called
  `hello_world` to the Particle Cloud. This event is visible under Logs in
  the Console and can be consumed by integrations, webhooks, or other devices.

  It’s an excellent first step for learning how to build connected projects using
  Particle’s cloud APIs and real-time device communication.
